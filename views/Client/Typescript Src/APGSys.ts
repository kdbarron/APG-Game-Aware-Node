/**

 * This file contains the two primary interfaces you'll use to interact with the client app.
 *
 * To setup a new game, in your game's .html file, you'll set two functions as fields in the object appParms.
 * The parameters for these two functions will be the two interfaces found below.
 *
 * The first is an asset caching function named cacheFunction, which will register all the external data files
 * used by your game (images, sounds, json files, google web fonts).  Your client app won't actually run until
 * all external assets have been downloaded.  The asset caching function will have, as a parameter, a
 * an object with a Cacher interface, which provides functions to register different asset types for caching.
 *
 * The second function actually launches your game. It is called gameLaunchFunction.  This function will have,
 * as a paramater, an object with a APGSys interface.  This interface handles sending and recieving network
 * traffic with the server, exposes cached JSON data, and also contains a reference to a live, constructed
 * PhaserJS Game object.
